With the laptops under 300 dollars, you can perform day-to-day tasks like managing excel sheets, creating docs, creating business proposals easily.

But some of the laptops in this list are capable of doing it. There are some potential laptops that you can find within your budget, so let's dive into the list.</p>
          <h4>What You Can Expect from These Laptops?</h4>
          <p>These laptops can perform all the tasks but not as fast as other higher budget laptops do. For that reason, you should avoid running large software simultaneously, play games, or keep the laptop running for days. Eventually, it affects the performance of your laptop especially the laptops under $300. While using these laptops, you need to be accurate in unplugging the charger once fully charged, limit the programs running at startup, turn off visual effects, shut down regularly, run fewer programs at the same time.</p>
          <p>Once you start taking care of these little things, your laptop will work well for a longer period. Now, let's dive into the list of amazing laptops under $300.</p>

          <p>Another big advantage of this laptop is nothing but weight. It weighs just 2.5 pounds which is lesser than the average laptop weight. If you travel more often and you have to carry a laptop along with you then considering HP Stream 11 can be a good choice.</p><hr>

          <img src="../assets/Acer_Chromebook_314.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="Acer Chromebook 314" style="width: 80%"><br>

Also, it provides 64GB of internal storage 100 GB storage of Google drive which is enough to store your document. But one thing you need to remember is that uploading documents on the cloud and downloading from there might be time-consuming. Not only on this device but on all Chromebook laptops. Apart from that, it is worth buying a laptop.</p><hr>
          <h2>Acer aspire 1</h2>
          <h3>Windows</h3>
          <img src="../assets/Acer_aspire_1.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="Acer aspire 1" style="width: 80%"><br>
          <p>Acer Aspire 1 is a windows 10 laptop that offers 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, big 15.6 inches full HD display which is a great functionality you need in a laptop under 300. An attractive design is a bonus. We would highly recommend this laptop if you are not a traveler and you do not carry a laptop along with you. Because the battery life of Acer aspire 1 is just 7 hours which is slightly less than other laptops on the list and it weighs 4.1 pounds. Substracting these small issues, it is a great laptop for frequent users.</p><hr>
          <h2>Lenovo Chromebook Duet</h2>
          <h3>Chromebook</h3>
          <img src="../assets/Lenovo_Chromebook_Duet.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Duet" style="width: 80%"><br>
          <p>The battery life of the Lenovo Chromebook duet is the biggest plus. It lasts almost around 12 hours but only if it is used ideally otherwise the battery can last around 10 to 11 hours which is great. Apart from that Lenovo Chromebook duet offers 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and fully High definition display, and 10.1 inches of display which is smaller than the other competitors.</p>
          <p>This laptop is tinier than the other laptops which means that the keyboard size is also compressed and typing might not be as comfortable as the other laptops. I see the small size is the only disadvantage of this laptop, apart from that it's an awesome laptop.</p><hr>
          <h2>HP Chromebook 14</h2>
          <h3>Chromebook</h3>
          <img src="../assets/hp_chromebook_14.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="HP Chromebook 14" style="width: 80%"><br>
          <p>HP Chromebook 14 is one of the best laptops under 300 dollars if your top priorities are long battery life, 1080P display, and attractive designs. Along with that, HP Chromebook also offers 4GB RAM, 32GB storage, 14 Inches display, and just 3.3 pounds of weight. This laptop works great for small daily tasks but while running big apps it may not work well and might become slow hence performance is an issue.</p>
          <p>The Keyboard size is big and comfortable. So, great for office work in document creation, proposal creation, and watching movies online or offline.</p><hr>
          <h2>Samsung Chromebook 3</h2>
          <h3>Chromebook</h3>
          <img src="../assets/Samsung_Chromebook_3.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="Samsung Chromebook 3" style="width: 80%"><br>
          <p>Another Chromebook laptop and they have become the face of the budget laptops. The first time, Samsung makes it to the list. Intel Celeron N3060 processor, 4 GB RAM which weighs just 2.50 pounds. Electric fast speed and long-lasting battery(almost 11 hours) are the biggest plus points of this laptop. If performance is everything you need in a laptop then selecting Samsung Chromebook 3 is the right option. It has a good quality camera as well if you go on a client calls more often then this laptop will work wonders for you.</p><hr>
          <h2>Lenovo Chromebook C330</h2>
          <h3>Chromebook</h3>
          <img src="../assets/Lenovo_Chromebook_C330.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="Lenovo Chromebook C330" style="width: 80%"><br>
          <p>Lenovo Chromebook C330 has almost 10 hours of battery life along with 4GB RAM and 32 GB of storage. 11.6 inches of wide display and a comfortable keyboard. It weighs less than 3 pounds, perfect if you need to carry your laptop while traveling.</p>
          <p>There are a few cons of this laptop as well. Performance is not as good as other competitors. You can't work on multiple applications at once, the laptop may slow down. Along with that, the audio player and screen display are not up to the mark as well. We would recommend this laptop for those who work on a simple in-built application and use this for regular day-to-day tasks.</p><hr>
          <h2>Dell Inspiron 11</h2>
          <h3>Windows</h3>
          <img src="../assets/Dell_Inspiron_11.jpg" class="w3-margin w3-padding" alt="Dell Inspiron 11" style="width: 80%"><br>
          <p>Not many laptops offer 128 GB of Storage when you are looking for a laptop under 300 dollars. Along with 128 GB memory, Dell Inspiron offers 4 GB of RAM and an eleven-inch HD display. It is also a convertible laptop that can be used as a tablet as well. Dell Inspiron works wonder while working on a group and discuss certain topics very often.</p>
          <p>Also, it weighs just 2.5 pounds which is way lighter than the other laptops. Just 6 hours of battery life is a minus point while other competitors in this list offer much higher battery life. Overall, this laptop is not built for gaming but it's a good choice for students and businessmen to perform business routine tasks. Unlike Chromebook laptops, you do not need to store data on the cloud, you have 128 GB of data on the local storage. So, this can be helpful if you are dealing with a lot of computer data in the form of sheets, docs, PPT presentations, or PDFs.</p>
